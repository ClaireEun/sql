**Write**: Reflect on your previous work and how you would adjust to include ethics and inequity components. Total length should be a few paragraphs, no more than one page.



Reflecting on my previous work as a nurse, I realize that ethical considerations and addressing inequities are increasingly important, and I could have been more proactive in recognizing and tackling them. During my time as a nurse, I often had to make decisions that involved ethical dilemmas, such as prioritizing patients based on their medical needs, financial conditions, or access to healthcare. At the time, I followed the hospital's policies and the established prioritization methods, as I was part of a larger healthcare team.

However, looking forward, I would aim to focus more on ensuring equal access to healthcare services for all patients, regardless of their background or financial status. This might involve advocating for vulnerable patients, ensuring that they receive the care and attention they need, and working to reduce any disparities in healthcare delivery. By integrating ethics and equity into my practice, I believe I can contribute to creating a more fair and compassionate healthcare environment.
